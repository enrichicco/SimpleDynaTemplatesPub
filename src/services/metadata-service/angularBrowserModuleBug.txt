problem:

the Meta service, available in

@angular/platform-browser

does not work well on the following attributes

- http-equiv
- charset

for instance, the tag replace method

.... some code ...
metaInstance.updateMeta(tagdefinition)
.... some code ...

uses a selecor function which tests for metas tag only with the following attributes:

- content
- name

so, when searching for an http-equiv or charset meta, it does not find anything.
The tag then is properly added, but the former one is not removed, giving place to duplicates, possibly different one from the other
